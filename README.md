# Classification_and_Regression_Algorithms_Comparative_Analysis
This project is an investigation of how various regression and classification machine learning algorithms rank for the same large data set. The three regression algorithms used are multiple linear regression, the decision tree, and support vector machines. These operated on hourly weather data from 122 weather stations in Southeast (Sudeste) Brazil aiming to predict the temperature. The classification algorithms are logistic regression, decision tree, and Naive Bayes. The classification data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel where the possibility of booking was predicted. Included are two R notebooks for each study and a knitted PDF. The data sets are cited in all files.
